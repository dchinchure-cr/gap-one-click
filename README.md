# checkred-gcp-integration
CheckRed CSPM GCP Integration for GCP 1-Click deployment 

## Project Setup

Google Cloud Platform organizes resources into projects.

If you don't have project ready, [Create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) to ensure that you have the permissions you needed, or select an existing project in which you have the relevant permissions to integrate with CheckRed Platform.

## Enable IAM API for generating short-lived credentials & impersonating service accounts. 

NOTE: deploy.sh will create the Service account in your project.

Please copy the output **service_account_email** from Cloud Shell console and paste into the CheckRed GCP Impersonation account on CheckRed platform

```bash
sh deploy.sh <GCP_PROJECT_ID> <CHECKRED_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

Please replace the <GCP_PROJECT_ID> and <CHECKRED_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> with GCP Project ID and CheckRed impersonation service account email address.
